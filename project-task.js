üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary

/* Fixes made
1. Removed const variable are replaced it with a key in the main object
2. Removed backtick encasing the whole object
3. Added "" to name key in first guest object 
4. Replaced undefined with null
5. Removed extra comma at the end of the amenities array
6. removed ; from end of JSON object

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?

// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?

  The main tools I used for this practice were using online validators such as JSONlint and also using the built in features in VS Code to identify errors

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?

  After I did my initial fixes to errors that I saw in the JSON right away, I placed my code into JSONlint, an online validator, and fixed any remaining syntax errors that it showed me  

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?
  The extra comma at the end of the array took me a minute to spot because it was at teh very end and commas are such small characters that I looked past it once or twice before seeing the issue.
4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)

   Test and validate your code often to finde problems before they appear and to catch you from making the same mistake over and over again in your code.
